# Song_Recs

This is a script to recommend songs to users based on a song they entered.

Versions 1 and 2 are shortcut/test ways of doing it, as they use shortcut statistics to find recommendations.
These are the versions I came up with when learning how to use python and the spotify api.

Version 3 is slightly better.
